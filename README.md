This is just an idea of a cool development proxy server

* Response replay for long loading services
* CSS watch to update page on the fligh
* JS watch to refresh the page
* HTTP Auth / proxy destination configuration
* List of different configurations
* Postman export of requests
* Custom logic to modify or mock requests
